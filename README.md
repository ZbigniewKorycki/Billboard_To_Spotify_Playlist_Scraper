<h1>Billboard To Spotify Playlist Scraper</h1>

This Python script allows you to scrape the top 100 songs from Billboard charts for a specified date and add them to a private Spotify playlist. It leverages the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify API.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 46.
